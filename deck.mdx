# Managing tasks
Question: How do you move a mountain?

Well first by moving small stones. This was a saying that stuck with me for a long time and essentially shows that when handling tasks, 
you need to take large problems and break them down into small parts. After seeing the big picture, ensure you start breaking that down into smaller manageable parts.

# Managing time

Time is a concept that has a big impact on our lives. We always say "I need more time" or "I didn't have enough time".

Question: What would you do if you had all the time in the world?

This ties back to more about being wiser with how you use your time. If you have smaller tasks to complete, it will make it easier for you to leverage your time more efficiently.

# Managing goals

Goal setting is important in achieving innovation. You need to have clearly defined goals that are measurable.

Example: I want at the end of the Bloom Project to be more knowledgable in how to use Slack.

This is quantifiable as you can look and measure how much of Slack did you know about before and after you started the Bloom Project.
