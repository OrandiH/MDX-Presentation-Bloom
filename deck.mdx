# Managing Tasks
Question: How do you move a mountain? - "Well first by moving small stones"

This was a saying that stuck with me for a long time and essentially shows that when handling tasks, 
you need to take large problems and break them down into small parts. 

_After seeing the big picture, ensure you start breaking that down into smaller manageable parts._

# Managing Time

Time is a concept that has a big impact on our lives. *We always say "I need more time" or "I didn't have enough time".*

Question: What would you do if you had all the time in the world? _This ties back to more about being wiser with how you use your time._ 

If you have smaller tasks to complete, it will make it easier for you to leverage your time more efficiently.

# Managing Goals

Goal setting is important in achieving innovation. You need to have clearly defined goals that are measurable.

_Example: I want at the end of the Bloom Project to be more knowledgable in how to use Slack._

This is quantifiable as you can look and measure how much of Slack did you know about before and after you started the Bloom Project.
